<p>I am really curious what the future of Ham radio looks like. I have several times in my life tried to explore this hobby but mostly was turned off from it by the fact that it didn’t seem to offer much compared to what I could do on the internet aside from using public spectrum. Don’t get me wrong, I think it is cool and I see the use case for emergency response situations. But the idea of the community just never struck the cord with me how other communities have (mostly old white dudes, it seems).
Am I wrong? Is there a place for hams in the world where you can more quickly and reliably reach anyone from anywhere across the internet?</p>

<p>I have two WSPR beacons running, one in Sunnyvale CA and the other in Binyamina-Giv'at Ada, Israel. Both are running 200 mw into EFHW antennas just 6 meters off the ground. I can routinly pick up the signals between the two sites.
I get signal reports everwhere from a US military base at the South Pole, Australia, and throughout Europe and Asia.

The transmitters are homemade, a Rapsperry Pi Pico, and a small external circuit of a Si5355, a couple of MOSFETS and a lowpass filter -- maybe $30 in parts.

It's fascinating how the amount of electrons needed to light up a few LEDs can be heard around the world when modulated correctly.</p>

<p>I agree with the sentiment of this. I think our obsession with innate mathematical skill and genius is so detrimental to the growth mindset that you need to have in order to learn things.
I've been working a lot on my math skills lately (as an adult). A mindset I've had in the past is that "if it's hard, then that means you've hit your ceiling and you're wasting your time." But really, the opposite is true. If it's easy, then it means you already know this material, and you're wasting your time.</p>

<p>I strongly believe that the average human being can be exceptional in any niche topic given enough time, dedication and focus.
I respectfully, but strongly, disagree. There's a reason most NBA players are over 2 meters tall, and one does not become taller with time, dedication nor focus.

It might be different for intellectual skills but I am not that sure.

Almost anyone can become decent at almost anything though. Which is good already!</p>
